Welcome to SeisBench's documentation!
=====================================

The Seismology Benchmark Colection (*SeisBench*) provides a unified API for accessing 
and training of machine learning algorithms across seismic datasets. It has been built to 
alleviate traditional bottlenecks when applying machine learning techniques to seismic data, 
in particular the processes of data collection and labelling.

*SeisBench* is built to be extensible and modular, allowing for easy addition of new models 
and datasets. Users are explicitly encouraged to contribute, as any future iterations will
be based of community feedback.
