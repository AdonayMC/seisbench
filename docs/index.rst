Welcome to SeisBench's documentation!
=====================================

The Seismology Benchmark collection (*SeisBench*) is an open-source python toolbox for 
machine learning in seismology. It provides a unified API for accessing 
and training machine learning algorithms on seismic datasets. SeisBench has been built to 
alleviate traditional bottlenecks when applying machine learning techniques to seismic data, 
in particular the steps of data collection and labelling.

To learn more about the dataset API, including the datasets currently integrated see :ref:`benchmark_datasets`. Alternatively,
if you would like to know more about how to build, and train models, along with information on the machine learning models 
readily available through *SeisBench*, see :ref:`models`. 

SeisBench is built to be extensible and modular, allowing for easy incorporation of new models 
and datasets. Users are explicitly encouraged to contribute, as any future iterations will
be based of community feedback.
