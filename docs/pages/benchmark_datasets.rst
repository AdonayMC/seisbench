Benchmark Datasets
=====================

SeisBench facilitates the downloading of a suite of publicly available seismic waveform datasets 
for training of machine learning algorithms. An overview of the contents of each dataset is below, 
along with the corresponding citation. 

ETHZ
-----
The :py:class:`~seisbench.data.ethz.ETHZ` benchmark dataset contains regional recorded seismicity on publicly available networks 
throughout the Swiss region. For more information see: `SED website 
<http://www.seismo.ethz.ch/en/research-and-teaching/products-software/waveform-data/>`__.

Dataset contains 36,743 waveform examples.

INSTANCE
--------
The INSTANCE benchmark dataset is a dataset of signals comiled by the INGV. Containing
~1.2 million 3C waveform traces, which record ~50,000 earthquakes and include ~130,000 noise traces.
Magnitude scale of events ranges from 0-6.5.
The dataset is split for ease of use into Noise examples :py:class:`~seisbench.data.instance.InstanceNoise`,
waveform examples in counts :py:class:`~seisbench.data.instance.InstanceCounts`, and waveform examples in 
ground motion units :py:class:`~seisbench.data.instance.InstanceGM`. A combined dataset containing the noise examples
and waveform examples as counts is also available :py:class:`~seisbench.data.instance.InstanceCountsCombined`.

    Dataset size:

    * waveforms (counts) **~160Gb**
    * waveforms (ground motion units) **~310Gb**

SCEDC
-----
The :py:class:`~seisbench.data.scedc.SCEDC` benchmark dataset contains all publicly available recordings
of seismic events in the Southern Californian Seismic Network, which were manually picked, from
2000-2020. Contains ~8,100,000 waveform examples.

STEAD
-----
The :py:class:`~seisbench.data.stead.STEAD` dataset is a published benchmark dataset (see citation below) of local seismic signals -
both earthquake and non-earthquake - along with noise examples. In total there are ~1.2 million time series, of which ~100,000
are noise examples and the remaining contain seismic arrivals. 450,000 earthquakes are contained in the datasets.
