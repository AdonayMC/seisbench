SeisBench - The Seismology Benchmark collection

## Code formatting
SeisBench currently uses the [black code formatter](https://github.com/psf/black) (subject to change).
The formatter can be installed using pre-commit hooks.
To do so, run the following commands inside the repository:
```
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```
Note that the black code style can be imposed later as well,
so if you are experiencing issues with installing black, just ignore the style.
